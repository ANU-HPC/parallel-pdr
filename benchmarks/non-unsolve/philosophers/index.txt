philosophers.pddl: Philosophers domain spec.

component-atom-sets.pddl: Decomposition of the philosophers domain.

mk-instance.sh: Script to generate philosophers problem instances.

Usage: mk-instance.sh [-l] [-s] <number of philosophers>

Default is to create an instance with reachable deadlock state;
option -l causes it to create a live instance.

Option -s causes component atoms sets to be added to the spec.

Number of philosophers must be at least 2.


telegraph.pddl: Optical telegraph domain. Note: this domain is based
on the same promela spec as the IPC-4 domain, and has the same bug.
This bug causes problems to have a deadlock even when they shouldn't
have (when the stations are in a line, instead of a circle).

telegraph-with-prio.pddl: Version of the optical telegraph domain
with the bug fixed. With this version, problems where the stations
are not in a circle are deadlock free.

telegraph-with-prio-nnp.pddl: Corrected optical telegraph domain,
formulation without negative preconditions.

mk-telegraph-instance.sh: Script to generate optical telegraph
instanes.

Usage: mk-telegraph-instance.sh [-l] [-p] [-n] [-s] <num>

where <num> is the number of telegraph stations, which must be
at least 2.

Options:

-l: Generate a live instance (stations in a line).
-p: Generate instance for the telegraph-with-prio domain.
-n: Generate instance for the telegraph-with-prio-nnp domain.
-s: Write component atom sets.
